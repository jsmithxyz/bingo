# Bingo App

A Javacript-based desktop application that acts as a virtual bingo ball cage machine, that picks random bingo balls displays those that are already chosen on a grid.

## User Story

- AS A user wanting to host a virtual bingo night,
- I WANT to be able to display the balls that are being chosen for all players,
- SO THAT we can play bingo and social distance at the same time.

## Overview

This is a very simple application that allows you to host a virtual bingo night, and display the balls for the players as they are chosen. My friend wanted to throw a bingo birthday party while we were quarantining, so I made this desktop app to display over Zoom as we all played bingo in our own homes.

It utilizes vanilla Javascript, Google Fonts, and Image from Pixabay , and icons from Flaticon designed by [Nikita Golubev](https://www.flaticon.com/authors/nikita-golubev "Nikita Golubev")
